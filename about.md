Hi!

My name is Artem (pronounced Artyom) Korkhov. I'm a Software Engineer, surfer, human living in Stockholm, Sweden.

I'm originally from Moscow, Russia, where I lived first 25 years of my life. In late 2017 I moved to Sweden, where I reside since then.

Since 2022 I'm a Staff Engineer in Systems Research team in RiskOps startup Feedzai. I was building Spotify's ML Platform for 3+ years before that, authoring the platform that powers almost all of the low-latency ML model serving in the company. I also have my hand in most of the ML infrastructure solutions built there.

Before Spotify and Sweden I worked in various much smaller companies in Moscow, building things such as recommender systems, data analytics systems, marketing automation projects and so on.

When I'm not working or spending time with my partner/family/friends you can probably find me surfing, which is my biggest non-people related passion.

If you want to work/chat with me, the best way to reach out is to use Telegram: `at artyomka`. 
Email might do as well: `artyom dot korkhov at gmail dot com`
