Hi!

My name is Artem (pronounced Artyom) Korkhov. I'm a Software Engineer, surfer, human living in Stockholm, Sweden.

I'm originally from Moscow, Russia, where I lived first 25 years of my life. In late 2017 I moved to Stockholm to work for [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/). Currently I'm a Senior Software Engineer in Machine Learning Platform team, working primarily on ML Serving infrastructure project called Salem, which I co-founded in 2019.

While there isn't much public information on Salem (hopefully, _yet_), it is _the_ ML Serving solution used at Spotify for use-cases ranging from Home page to much-much lower traffic scenarios.

Before Spotify and Sweden I worked in various much smaller companies in Moscow, building things such as recommender systems, data analytics systems, marketing automation projects and so on.

When I'm not working or spending time with my partner/family/friends you can probably find me surfing, which is my biggest non-people related passion.

If you want to work/chat with me, the best way to reach out is to use Telegram: `at artyomka`. 
Email might do as well: `artyom dot korkhov at gmail dot com`
