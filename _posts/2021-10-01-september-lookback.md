*Lookbacks is the practice that is inspired by [Artem](https://agentcooper.io/) and consists of reflections on a past month. I don't think that there is a particular format I want to follow in these posts, the goal is to capture important and noteworthy things that happened in past month.*

## Events

September feels really good. I did my first surf trip of 2021 with close friends, been in 3 countries and generally got a feeling of being content.

### Portugal trip

The first highlight of the month is the Portugal trip which we did with Igor and Artem in the first half of September. I clocked in a few dozens of surfing hours and perhaps even more â€“ in quality discussions with friends. I come to realize that those two things - deep talks with smart people and surfing - are probably among those few that make me truly happy.

In surfing, a sense of usual underachievement is coupled with a sense of actually learning a thing or two and getting better. I guess this is expected. The key takeaways are:
* My pop-up is still worse than I need it to be. The back foot lands closer to the middle of the board, while I need it to land squarely on the traction pad towards the guard.
* I don't have a muscle memory of driving turns with back foot. Together with the first point, this is something that I need to doubledown on during dry land practice. Cutbacks, snaps won't become better without it.
* Quite often, the thing that matters the most is... commitment. One can't ride a wave without catching it first, and that, sometimes, is scary business. But more often than not, you've got to commit and do it. (Of couse, carefully weighting in any risks, but, again, frequently they are exaggerated)

The last item weirdly reminds me of many things in life.

To conclude the surfing theme, I finally bought my second board! It's from Pyzel surfboards, model [`Shadow`](https://europe.pyzelsurfboards.com/index.php?page=surfboard-details&id=8929), stock dims with 6'2 length.
Definitely above my current abilities. But definitely better fit in dimensions and volume as well. I'm super stoked about riding it and looking forward to paddle out on it again soon!

The second highlight is the amount of quality time we got to spent together with friends. It's been forever! Had lots of fun, as we always do, but more importantly, I feel unusually refreshed and inspired by all the ideas we discussed and exchanged. 

Some of those themes, the ones that I can remember and the ones of particular interest now:
* Working in public - making your private work public to employ additional accountability, facilitate sharing, learn and so on. I found this idea very interesting and inspiring; and this very blog and post are the results of that.
* Community living. A theme that my girlfriend was mentioning to me a couple of times. Perhaps eventually deserves a separate post
* CRISPR.
* Working on side projects/spinning up a startup.

### Trip to Kazan

My girlfriend took me to a weekend trip to Kazan, Russia, to see the place and meet her parents. We took a night train there, something that I haven't done in at least 5 years. Russian Railways have definitely improved their services, albeit ramped up the costs as well.

I absolutely loved everything about the trip. Meeting partner's parents for the first time is always stressful (I imagine, for all parties involved), but I feel very welcomed and grateful.

### General notes

Last week of September I got into a nice working rhythm and focus. But started to feel a need of having an additional hour or two a day to complete just the things I want to do, not even to have some "me time" poured purely into recuperating activities.

## Entertainment

Continuing with `Ted Lasso`. There are a lot of good things written about it, but I can't get enough of Jason Sudeikis's acting.

In Portugal we've watched [`Decoding Watson`](https://www.amazon.com/American-Masters-Decoding-Watson-James/dp/B07L8KL44G). Controversial person, but very interesting documentary. Can recommend.

Have started and almost finished `Dune`. I haven't read any prose in a very, very long time and had doubts that I'll like it, but it beat my expectations profoundly. I have to force myself to put the book down and get to sleep/work depending on part of the day.

## Projects

I haven't done any projects per se, but talking to my friends have hopefully given me a gentle nudge that I evidently needed. 

I never bothered myself with learning any client platform. Mobile always felt a bit distant from my main area of interest and Web... well, I think it's just bad cliches that I've picked up. But I don't want to touch it :) 

Anyhow, for a while now I've entertained thoughts about side projects, and for those I've decided to dip my toes into iOS/MacOS platforms. Firstly, to learn a client platform that I use myself. Secondly, to be able to have relatively tangible side projects.

## Misc 

One day I stumbled upon a [Telegram post](https://t.me/vladzelyzip/1493) mentioning a tool I haven't heard about yet: [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/). 

The concept of an infinite list with infinite depth of bullet points instantly hit home and I decided to give it a spin. I've been using it for a week so far and it has been **amazing**. It is the best organizer app I've seen (likely) ever. 

So far I think I like it because it really follows the way I think and go about things. Feels wonderful to not have to shoehorn my mental model into a tool (I sense there is a broader lesson here). Will continue using it, and gonna see in a month if it sticks.

## Plans

October brings another couple of weeks in Moscow with my beloved ones, a few chores to fix and preparation for the second surf trip at the beginning of November.

As major themes, I'd like to be more disciplined and pursue a couple of goals:
* Get going with iOS
* Work on surfing muscle memory

I'm also pretty excited about The International - biggest annual Dota 2 tournament, on which I'm gonna root for OG.

Besides all that there could also be a couple of exciting but challenging opportunities at work, but it's too nebulous to talk about yet.

Haven't read much this month, but these are the few links I'd like to put forward and share:
