Hello, world.

It's truly weird to create a personal page in 2021, but here we go. This is actually my first ever proper attemt at this, so let it serve as an excuse.

I honestly haven't come to the realization that I need a personal page myself. A good friend of mine, [Artem Tyurin](https://agentcooper.io/) inspired me to do it with the idea of `working in public`. I'm not 100% confident yet that it'll stick to me, but I'm pretty excited now.

So, what this all gonna be about? I don't have a clear idea yet. But there are a few intentions that have been lingering around my mind for quite a while:
* I actually _enjoy_ writing. I do it extremely rarely, but when I do I often love it. Perhaps I can push myself to white more.
* `Working in public`. I found the idea really compelling, capable of bringing only good to several aspects of my life that I frequently find myself thinking about as areas of improvement: pursuing a side-project, formulating a proper finished argument for a topic, sharing experiences/thoughts.
* Putting some work ideas out there (ahem, here)

The ball is rolling. See ya
