I'm in Peniche, Portugal. After a month, again. Different place and different company though - this time we went with friends from work. And decided to try Peniche for a change - it has different scenery and much, much greater variaty of surf spots.

## Events
Most of October was spent in Moscow, together with Adelya. We've been up to many things this time.

First of all, we've been on a guided tour to the Moscow State Library, "Leninka" (in Lenin's name). I've never been inside that monumental building, so taking the tour was super interesting and educational. The tour's approach is "Moscow from an engineer's point of view", so besides regular suspects such as architecture and story of the building, the guide emphasised engineering aspects of library works - book delivery system, storage facilities and pneumatic mailing system that still works inside the library (moreover, it's actively used still). Caught myself thinking about how much that place is behind the actual technological frontier, but on the other hand - how well the existing system works and that it doesn't _really_ call for a replacement. One thing for sure - the old pneumatic mail system was engineered better than 90% of software folks produce nowadays, so having this insider knowledge I'd actually hold off with a replacement.

A couple of evenings we gathered with friends and played an interesting board game, [Machi Koro](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143884/machi-koro). Despite its simplistic look, the game actually can be quite strategic and demanding in discipline to stick to once chosen strategy. I greatly enjoyed playing it and would likely buy one set for myself in Stockholm.

Knowing about the upcoming surftrip, I decided to leverage Moscow's abundance of pretty much anything and booked a couple of surf skating lessons. Surfskate wasn't something totally new to me, but I've never tried to properly skate transitions and felt that I need some help with it, especially after having a nasty shoulder dislocation last year.

Actual experience was way beyond my expectations! Ramps turned out to be not _so_ scary. Surfskating dynamics on transitions resemble surfing very closely, much better than on flatground, so I've tried to practice some maneuvres I'm working on in water as well. I think that even those 2 sessions in Moscow (and one in Stockholm which I had last week after coming home) definitely helped.
Ended up buying a second surfskate, from [Roots](https://roots.su/). It has slightly different track construction than the one I had already, but I'm pretty happy with its behavior. I took it specifically for learning transitions and so far it's been working well.

We've been to 2 theatre performances. The first one, "Shoot/Get Treasure/Repeat" was definitely nicely done, but its format was a little bit too difficult for me - there wasn't much "acting" going on, the play is very static and mostly audial. Felt like an elaborate podcast. And podcasts aren't really my format.

The second one was closer to classics. Went to Moscow Academic Theatre to watch Lavr. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance. The theatre itself felt significantly modernised in spirit and quality of settings; the acting was good and it was easy to almost binge all 3+ hours of it.

Met up with a few of my university friends. We had a super lovely evening, shared war stories and reconnected after quite some time. I'm not close with absolute majority of my university class, but these few are really dear to me. Good times :heart:

On our flight to Lisbon we had an unfavorable wind condition and the pilot had to take a second attempt to land the plane. Have to admit that I was scared AF (reciting all the info I knew about planecrashes). Everything ended up well though.

## Entertainment

I've finished reading Dune and finally watched the movie. The bulk of impressions from watching it immediately after finishing the book is a weird mixed bag - I definitely enjoyed it, but had no "wow" effect or serendipity of seeing some unexpected plot twist or turn. The movie is super solid work, but as a note to myself, I should try to separate reading books and watching movies based on them more, so there is a novelty element to the latter.

As a fun fact - when the first trailer came out a few years back, we together with friends thought that it would totally such to watch a movie without knowing the lore of it and decided to read the book. I had an impression that Villeneuve reasoned in exactly the same manner.

Watched the new James Bond movie as well. Was negatively surprised by the quality of characters and voice acting of russian translation (had to watch it in Russian, which is always a bit of a bummer - translation sucks almost always).

The highlights of October entertainment weren't movies, though. The first one is definitely The International 10, on which Team Spirit unexpectedly won the title. I was rooting for OG, but was incredibly happy about Team Spirit taking the Aegis - at the end of the day it's a CIS team. Becides, they displayed a truly Cinderella story - _nobody_ expected them to be that good, bookmakers coefficients were about ~29x on their win. Somebody got the bank, I imagine.

The second highlight is Nintendo Switch and Diablo II Resurrected. I ended up buying the new Switch OLED and didn't regret the purchase at all so far. D2 brings back good memories and nostalgia of playing that great game back in the days when I was a kid; Nintendo allows doing so while travelling.

I haven't tried the platform exclusives yet (like Zelda or Mario etc), but definitely plan to do so. Starting with Zelda, I think.

I also have done something I haven't done in a very long time - picked up a book in Russian, Вся Кремлевская Рать. It's effectively a compilation of "cool stories" from folks who held (or still holds) an office either in Kremlin or close to it (think business) during the beginning of Putin's reign. The book is very interesting, but I find it difficult to binge-read it - the events and actions described there are so outrageously wrong and bad that I get an urge to smoke a cigarette or two screaming "FUCK!" every couple of pages. I only have to wish for an event of poetic justice for almost all the actors described in the book, but struggle to find a proper definition of what could it be - few things seem fit.

## Projects

I've completed the SwiftUI tutorial, which took me way more than I thought it would. I kept derailing into some nuances of Swift or generally found it difficult to find time in October.

Learning Swift (as much as this process is still ongoing) was a very interesting experience. It's been a while since I learned a _modern_ programming language that doesn't pretend to be the smartest thing invented (hello, Scala). Swift feels modern, allows one to be productive and expressive. So far I liked absolute majority of things I saw, with a few exceptions, most notably the borrowed `?` and `!` for Optional values. These punctuation symbols are _so_ unnecessary in my opinion and do not really bring any value to the table. 

Once I get more exposure and practice with Swift, I perhaps should write an entire post with my impressions and experience.

Despite completing the course, I didn't find time to work on the iOS app idea. It's still marinading in my brain and I plan to take a stab at it in November.

## Misc

I was reading a telegram channel while stumbling upon a quote from an article there:

> make sure you’re playing the real game, not some more complicated game you’ve made up for yourself.

The quote is taken from the article ["Are You Playing to Play, or Playing to Win?"](https://commoncog.com/blog/playing-to-play-playing-to-win/). I _strongly_ recommend reading it. I found myself full of these scrub behaviors, especially passion for "maestro" behavior in craft, both at work and at sports. Moreover, according to what I've seen, engineers from CIS countries usually exhibit such traits at work, praising hard skills over everything else. 

## Links

This month's links are ML-ops related and both are from Soumith Chintala

## Plans
November feels a little nebulous. I'll be in Portugal for another 10 days and after that back to Stockholm, working and changing my visa. Finally getting Permanent Residency! Technically, it should be one year to go till citizenship. However, this event makes planning nearly impossible - I have to wait for the visa and until I get it, I'll stay in Sweden.

Few things I want to nail down:

* Get a descent prototype (at least on paper) of my iOS sports diary app
* Write down 2 quite large vision proposals at work
* If visa allows, meet up with friends in the end of the month
  
Likely, November will be quite chill - I'm lucky to spend most of it with my girlfriend and quality time together is my first priority for the life part of "WLB".
